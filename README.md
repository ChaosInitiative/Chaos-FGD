# Strata FGDs
Hammer FDG files for Strata games.

The repo is a stripped-down version of [TeamSpen210's HammerAddons](https://github.com/TeamSpen210/HammerAddons) project, with only the FTD-related stuff kept.
To see the code of the postcompiler we ship with Portal 2: Community Edition, look at [this repo](https://github.com/StrataSource/HammerAddons).
