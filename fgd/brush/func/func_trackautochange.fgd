= func_trackautochange : 
	"An entity that works as a rotating/moving platform that will carry a train to a new track. "+
	"It must be larger in X-Y planar area than the train, since it must contain the train within "+
	"these dimensions in order to operate when the train is near it. The track will rotate around its own origin. "+
	"This entity will only allowed to be triggered if the train is on a path_track which is a dead end. "+
	"If Auto Activate Train flag is ticked, train isn't paused at the top/bottom of the path after func_trackautochange has finished it's movement. Instead, it will continue moving forward and doesn't need to be reactivated by trigger. "+
	"If selected, the platform only rotates in place of it's origin without travelling specified altitude. The top and the bottom path_tracks should have their origin positioned in the same coordinates."
